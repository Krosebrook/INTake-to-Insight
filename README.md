**InfoGenius Vision** is an enterprise-grade visual intelligence platform. It leverages Google's Gemini 3 Pro model to transform abstract business objectives and raw data sources into high-fidelity, editable dashboard mockups and infographics.

This application is designed as a **Local-First** Single Page Application (SPA), ensuring data privacy and offline capability by storing sensitive project data within the user's browser (IndexedDB) rather than a central cloud database during the prototype phase.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Generative Intelligence
- **Prompt-to-Dashboard:** Instantly generate professional UI mockups based on high-level descriptions (e.g., "Q3 Financial Overview for Stakeholders").
- **Visual Refinement:** iteratively edit visuals using natural language (e.g., "Change the charts to be dark mode," "Add a user growth metric").
- **Search Grounding:** (Beta) Synthesizes real-world data to inform visual content.

### 🎨 Creative Control
- **Brand Kit System:** Enforce corporate identity with global settings for logos, color palettes, and typography.
- **Canvas Editor:** Drag-and-drop annotation system, layer management (z-index), and precise grid snapping.
- **Multi-Modal Export:** Export designs as high-res PNG, JPG, or PDF for presentations.

### 🛡️ Enterprise Ready
- **Local Persistence:** Auto-saves work to IndexedDB; no data loss on refresh.
- **Audit Logging:** Tracks all generation, edit, and export events for compliance.
- **Security:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) simulation and audit trails.

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons)
- **AI Integration:** Google GenAI SDK (`@google/genai`)
- **Persistence:** IndexedDB (via custom wrapper)
- **State Management:** React Context + Local State (Lifted)
